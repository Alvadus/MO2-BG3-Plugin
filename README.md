# OVERVIEW

Adding this plugin to your Mod Organizer 2 instance will give you basic BG3 support, including full nexus download
support and all other mod organizer features you know and love, including per profile save management.

Keyzma's Root Builder Plugin is an optional dependency if you want to be able to use dll mods or
anything that goes in the /bin folder without having to muddy up your
BG3 install folder

In my personal testing, this is capable of loading dll mods, such as achievement enabler and script extender.

# INSTALLATION

Go to your Mod Organizer 2 installation folder and navigate to
"plugins/basic_games/games" and put "game_baldursgate3.py" and the "baldursgate3" folder in there.
